# Introduction to Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to predict the yield of wild blueberries using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement

The target feature is **yield** which is a continuous variable. The task is to
classify this variable based on the other 17 features step-by-step by going
through each day's task. The evaluation metrics will be _RMSE_ score

## Steps Performed

1. Load the data
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Preprocess the data
4. Do Feature Selection and Feature Engineering
5. Train a regression model
6. Evaluate the model
7. Tune the model
8. Re-evaluate the tuned model

## Conclusion

The lowest RMSE yield is `146.244` which was obtaind after the tuning of
the model using **GridSearchCV**
